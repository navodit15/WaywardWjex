## THE NEXT BIG THING? 
## Part (1/2)
 This blog is mostly what i have understood reading research stuff from both ends of the spectrum about good and bad consequences of AI and what I have been able to infer throughout my adventures of reading these papers.

Spoiler : I'am no PHD and everything I say here is just what i understood after reading papers written by those pioneers .

On one side are People like Nick Bostrom , Elon Musk themselves being skeptical about the idea of super intelligent AI  . And on the other end are a people like Eliezer Yudkowsky ,Ben Goertzel ,Geohot to name a few people who i admire who believe that Technological singularity is nearer. 

I haven't actually gotten time to read Super-intelligence by Bostrom as a whole , but i have read bits of it and heard his various talks and podcasts.  I have also carefully listened to Elon Musk's take on Superintelligent AI. Some of the issues raised make a lot of sense , for example Elon mentions in on of his talks  how humans do not have an issue with ants but while building highways we do destroy ant holes without a second thoughts. so "What if" in the near future some smarter AI thinks of us being the way of the next advancement and does the same to us as we do to those ants.

 

### A disparity in thinking

Now to put into perspective of how a normal person from the general population thinks about  AI , for most of them it's just a literal black box thing that's way smarter and for some reason would want to , at some point take over the world . It's not their fault either aharass lot of their views are influenced by stuff that is easy to digest and seems interesting the same ways movies do . A large chunk of this population are people use technology for their in their daily lives but are not aware what Artificial Intelligence  or how far we have come in recent years. There knowledge or views were mostly from highlights of some big AI news like AlphaGo beating Humans , having a very rough idea of how it worked . Other examples where one of news bits from twitter or reddit. A lot of people have their views influenced by movies like terminator etc, but as Yudkowsky puts it those are just movies and need to a stories of that sort to make it interesting for the general audiences. Now on that note The AlphaGo Documentary is a great watch as it show from different perspectives of people from different fields ranging from journalists to players , general audience to the research team that built it.

Even after talking to people around my age and similar field of interest . I found most of these people had misconceptions at philosophical level and had misunderstanding about the same . 

#### Fascinating real-world applications

The people pioneering in AI , Deep learning and their applications more visible to wider public like Andrej Karpathy , Demis Hassabis , Yann Lecun to name a few and a lot's of AI researcher's I've been looking at their reaches in my free time and it's astounding with the progress and ways of thinking about problems have been developed in recent times.

Some advancements that have occurred in recent times I've personally found dazzling are

- Alphafold by Deepmind . AI solving proteins folding is huge.

- Self driving cars - very broadly classified into Comma way and Tesla way of approaching a solution to self driving cars. 

- On the scarier side AI developing deepfakes.

And a lots of stuff being worked upon at Google Deepmind , OpenAI alongside a lot of interesting research work.

### The question here is What is singularity ?

If you simply google the term then Wikipedia tells you that is an Physics about a point in space time where gravitation field of a celestial body becomes infinite . This is not what I'm taking about here . The Singularity  I'm talking about here is technological singularity .

Wikipedia defines technological singularity as a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. Reading about Technological Singularity is one of the things that has had an impact of how I have started to look at things in general myself . Reading Yudkowsky's paper opened an entire new way of seeing things for me . I've been fascinated by this . 

Ray Kurzweil 's book Singularity is near is also a great read . Kurzweil believes that by the year 2045 we will experience the greatest technological singularity in the history of mankind: the kind that could, in just a few years, overturn the institutes and pillars of society and completely change the way we view ourselves as human beings.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLQNBfI97Ck) is a good explanation for singularity.

### My understanding and views

 From what i understand there will be an explosion in the field of AI and Computer Science in general at some point in the near future we will have machines that will be able to most of human work way better than we would have ever been able to do. 

For an example when Garry Kasparov lost to deep-blue he said that humans can work with machines to improve in the game and have a better understanding , but cut to today I've heard this a lot from top players how computers have killed the creativity in chess , a reason i think of is the ability to start from scratch and develop an understanding which is beyond human understanding . The concept of trying to win but by no matter what margin changes how we and machines evaluate the games or in general problems . Another example is protein folding done by deepmind.

The concern i have is that not everyone understands or even wants to put an effort towards it . I don't know if its human behavior but the one's in so called power never want to fix things . For example we can look at the current state of our country or even some developed nations for once . The number of people who are good and have a genuine interest in making things as they should are less but i argue they are the ones because of whom there is still little some good present today . Masses also do not know how to criticize and they often unknowingly hurt these people's mental in some ways . With A singularity in place there will be a lot more equality . 

The Sam Altman Blog mentioned below tackles some problems of wealth distribution and how even after replacement of jobs by AI will help the society.

### Some interesting reads/thoughts

- John Von Neumann's definition of the Singularity was that the Singularity is the moment beyond which "technological progress will become incomprehensively rapid and complicated."

- I found this recent blog by Sam Altman (CEO Y-Combinator). The blog was titled " Moore's law for everything " [blog](https://moores.samaltman.com/). It is an interesting read , I would recommend one to read it . Here he talks about the sorts of changes that will occur of good in society once we achieve singularity . The economies will change massively. The lifestyles of people , but most of this will affect largely developed countries.

- The clubhouse with Andrej Karpathy and Lex Fridman.

- Another not so related by super interesting read is Isaac Asimov's The Last Question.

### Problems and Issues raised 

- Failure of the thought from a philosophical Point of view.

- AI control problem awesome [blog](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2021/02/28/the-ai-control-problem.html)

- Hawking's and Einstein's fear of losing control to superintelligent machines
